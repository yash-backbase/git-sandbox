India, also known as the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. 

It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world.

The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE.

In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. 

Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose.

Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.

India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.
