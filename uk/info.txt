The United Kingdom, officially the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland but more commonly known as the UK[15] or Britain,[note 10] is a sovereign country lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland. 

The UK is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. The current monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 1952, making her the longest-serving current head of state. 

The United Kingdom's capital and largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million.

Other major urban areas in the UK include Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.

The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism.
